# Hello, Rust! ðŸ¦€
Hi! This is the code and notes about my Rust learning journey!
## My reference
Here some material that i've used during my journey.
### The Rust Programming Language - Book
[Official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) inclusive of all basic concepts of the language.
### Rustlings
[Official Rust Repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) with Rust exercises.
The project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!
